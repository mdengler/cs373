# CS 373 Unit 3.5: Exact or approximate

# Histogram Filters' exactness: approximate - my feel for this; he
# says this is because we are using discrete approximations of
# continuous functions

# Kalman Filters' exactness: approximate - my feel for this; he says
# this is because Kalman filters are only useful for linear functions
# whereas the world is non-linear
