# CS 373 Unit 1 HW2: Localization

Dim  #SV   State Variables
---  ---   ---------------
1     1    X
2     3    X, Y, XY-heading
3     6    X, Y, Z, XY-heading, YZ-heading, XZ-heading
4    10    X, Y, Z, C, 4c2 headings
5    15    5 coords, 5c2 headings
6    21    6 coords, 6c2


nCr = n! / (n-k)!k!

growth: n + nCr

This doesn't seem quadratic


Post-answer review:
I put down "none of the above".  I understood the question to be
asking how many _types_ of state variables, not how many _values_ each
variable could take.  Because he says the "number" of state variables
at one point, and that there are six of them.  For each variable, you
have a number of observations, and of course the amount of memory is
related to the number of observations raised to the power of the
number of state variables (if they all have the same sampling
frequency, which seems a very simplifying assumption).  I can see how
I should have read it now :(.
