# CS 373 Unit 2.14: Measurement and Motion 1

# Motion is called a convolution at Unit 1.3 3:30
# seconds. http://www.udacity.com/view#Course/cs373/CourseRev/feb2012/Unit/2/Nugget/2003
# . However then immediately after sensing is called "multiplying by a
# function" which sure sounds a lot like how convolution was (over?)
# simply explained.  I need to understand the distinction better.

# Sensing is product, motion is convolution
