# CS 373 Unit 1.22: Limit distribution

# Q: What is the limit distribution (also called the stationary
# distribution) given our uncertain move after moving infinitely many
# times?
#
# A: so my intuition here is that we are flattening the distribution a
# bit each step, or spreading out the probability of being in any
# particular place at any time, so we should end up in the uniform
# distribution state (state of maximum confusion).  The hint bears
# this out.
#
# Let's see...
#
# Yes, that's right.
