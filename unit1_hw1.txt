# CS 373 Unit 1 HW1: Probabilty
seemed simple enough
1) 0.8
2) 0.04
3) 0.12 + 0.12 = 0.24


Post-answer review:
1) is right
2) is right
3) is incorrect; should be:

0.6  = 0.6 * 0.2  + 0.6 * 0.8
p(Y) = p(Y|X)p(X) + p(Y|!X)p(!X)

The first observation I missed was that if X can only take on two
values, and the probability of Y given each of those two values is
defined to be the same number, then obviously it is this number that
is p(Y).  I didn't understand that X can only have two values, but I
think I often get confused between whether the notation p(X) refers to
X being an observation or a "random variable".  I have to make sure I
have this clear in each thing I read before I continue.

The next thing I failed to do was get the total probability part
right.  I'm not sure which thing I did wrong since I didn't write down
my work :(. By Total probability: p(Y) = sum for all i of
p(Y|X_i)p(X_i); i member of [0, 1], so X_0 = 0.2 and X_1 = 0.8 (1 -
0.2)...I'm not sure I see this yet, unfort, why X only has the two
values; is it just implied because we've only been given p(Y|X) and
p(Y|!X)?  I think it is.
