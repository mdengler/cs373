# CS 373 Unit 3.3: Belief Modality

# Histogram Filters' belief modality is multi-modal (there is no overt
# simple function defining belief, so it can be completely arbitrary
# and thus multi-modal)

# Kalman Filters' belief modality is uni-modal: belief is modeled as a
# gaussian distribution, which by definition / construction has only
# one mean
