# CS 373 Unit 2 HW3: Heavytail Gaussian

# Can we represent such a function as a gaussian?
#
# At first glance not.  at x = 0 we would want the function's value to
# be alpha, but if we set x to zero it will make the whole function
# evaluate to zero.  We would need a bias where we just add alpha to
# the whole function.
#
#
# I answered "NO", let's see how that goes.
